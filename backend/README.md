# Friday Backend

Phase 2 backend foundation for the Friday web-based AI agent, independent of n8n.

## Current capabilities

- PostgreSQL-backed task persistence and background worker execution.
- Stale-task recovery for interrupted workers.
- Gemini provider abstraction with function/tool calling.
- Agent orchestration with bounded steps.
- Safe built-in status/echo tools.
- Persistent conversations and messages.
- Persistent long-term memory records with text search.
- Database-backed task/agent execution events.
- Server-Sent Events endpoint for live task progress.
- User authentication with hashed passwords and revocable database sessions.
- User ownership checks for conversations, memories, and tasks.
- GitHub read tools for repositories, files, and code search.
- GitHub mutation tools for branches, files, and pull requests, protected by an explicit feature flag.
- Authenticated file storage with per-user ownership, size limits, checksums, and agent read/list tools.
- Controlled code execution with an explicit allowlist and default-off mutation gate.
- Read-only public web fetching with basic private-network/SSRF protections.
- Firecrawl-backed public web search with bounded result counts and normalized result metadata.
- Explicit API and service boundaries for future files, browser, code-execution, and deployment tools.

## Principles

- Friday backend is independent of n8n.
- Long-running work uses tasks and workers rather than holding an HTTP request open.
- AI providers and tools are implemented behind explicit interfaces.
- Runtime verification is performed against the deployed web backend; source-level checks alone are not considered sufficient.
- Protected APIs require a Bearer session token.
- GitHub mutations are disabled by default.

## Development

From this directory:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

The API defaults to port 3001.

## API

### Public
- GET /api/health
- GET /api/ready
- POST /api/auth/register
- POST /api/auth/login

### Authenticated
- GET /api/auth/me
- POST /api/auth/logout
- POST /api/chat
- POST /api/agent
- POST /api/conversations
- GET /api/conversations
- GET /api/conversations/:id/messages
- POST /api/conversations/:id/messages
- POST /api/memories
- GET /api/memories?q=...
- GET /api/files
- POST /api/files
- GET /api/files/:id
- POST /api/tasks
- GET /api/tasks/:id
- GET /api/tasks/:id/events — Server-Sent Events stream; supports ?after=<sequence>

### Agent GitHub tools

The agent registry currently exposes:
- github.list_repositories
- github.get_file
- github.search_code
- github.create_branch
- github.upsert_file
- github.create_pull_request
- files.list
- files.read
- code.run
- web.fetch
- web.search

Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` for GitHub access. Set `FRIDAY_ALLOW_GITHUB_MUTATIONS=true` only when repository mutations are intentionally authorized. The mutation flag defaults to false.

Production verification must be performed against the deployed backend and PostgreSQL environment; Friday does not depend on a local PC or local build for operation.
